# Student-Performance-Analytics


This project focuses on analyzing and predicting student academic performance using Machine Learning techniques.

## 📌 Project Objective
To analyze student data, identify key factors affecting academic performance, and predict final scores using regression models.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains information related to:
- Gender
- Study Hours
- Attendance
- Previous Scores
- Parental Education
- Internet Access
- Extra Classes

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
- Linear Regression (Baseline Model)
- Random Forest Regressor (Final Model)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📈 Model Evaluation
Regression performance is evaluated using:
- R² Score
- MAE
- MSE

Random Forest Regressor achieved higher accuracy compared to Linear Regression.
